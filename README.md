# RAG-based-chat-bot
Overview
This repository hosts a RAG-based-Chatbot, a powerful conversational AI system that leverages Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to provide accurate, contextually relevant, and up-to-date responses. Unlike traditional chatbots that rely solely on pre-trained knowledge, this RAG approach allows the chatbot to retrieve information from an external knowledge base and then generate responses based on that retrieved context, significantly reducing hallucinations and improving factual accuracy.

Features
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): Combines the strengths of information retrieval with large language model generation for enhanced accuracy.
Contextual Understanding: Processes user queries and retrieves relevant documents from a specified knowledge base.
Reduced Hallucinations: Minimizes instances where the model generates factually incorrect or nonsensical information.
Customizable Knowledge Base: Easily integrate your own documents, databases, or APIs to tailor the chatbot's knowledge.
Scalable Architecture: Designed to handle increasing amounts of data and user interactions efficiently.
Modular Design: Components are separated for easy understanding, modification, and extension.
How It Works
The RAG-based-Chatbot operates in two primary phases:

Retrieval Phase:

When a user asks a question, the system first analyzes the query to understand its intent and keywords.
It then searches a designated knowledge base (e.g., a collection of documents, a database, or a web API) to find the most relevant pieces of information. This is typically done using embedding models to find semantic similarity.
Generation Phase:

The retrieved relevant information is then fed as context to a powerful Large Language Model (LLM).
The LLM uses this context, along with the original user query, to generate a comprehensive, accurate, and coherent response.
This synergy ensures that the chatbot's answers are not only well-formed but also grounded in factual data.
